Attached is the pre-filled registration form for school year 2015-2016. Please
review the pre-filled registration form carefully, and read the instructions
below before clicking on any link.

If all information on the registration form is correct and no change is
necessary, please visit the school website<br/><br/>
<a href="https://www.westsidechineseschool.com/reg">https://www.westsidechineseschool.com/reg</a>
<br/><br/>
to register online for school year 2015-2016. Starting from this year,
returning students can register online by credit card - this is also preferred
method. Please note credit card payment is processed by an outside website 
<a href="https://stripe.com">stripe.com</a>. If you prefer to pay by check,
please contact registration team in the office, or print out the form and mail
it with your check to the school's P.O. Box address as indicated on the form.

If you need to update or change any information (such as address, contact
information, textbook preference, or adding or reducing the number of enrolled
children, etc.) which is preprinted <strong>in blue ink</strong> in the
pre-filled registration form, please contact the registration team to make
such changes before you register for the new school year. You have two options:
<ol>
  <li>If you register <strong>before this semester ends</strong>: Please go to
  the registration team in the office while the school is in session to make
  necessary changes. You can then pay the tuition/fees either by check or
  credit card on-site.
  </li>
  <li>If you register <strong>after this semester ends</strong>:  Please print
  out and mail the registration form with changes marked on the form together
  with a check for the tuition/fees to the schoolâ€™s P.O. Box address as
  indicated on the form.
  </li>
</ol>

The unfulfilled service point charge shown on the pre-filled registration form
only reflects the records as of May 9, 2015.  If you have unfulfilled service
point charge as of May 16, 2015, you have the following options:

<ol>
  <li>You may register now and pay the unfulfilled service point charge.
  However, if you subsequently fulfill all your service point requirement,
  the unfulfilled service point charge which has already been paid will
  <strong>not</strong> be refunded.</li>
  <li>You may wait until you have fulfilled all the service point requirement
  before you register for the new school year.</li>
</ol>

The payment system will reflect <a href="http://westsidechineseschool.weebly.com/check-service-points-265973542626381212094067025976.html">most recent service point records</a> published on school web site.

<strong>The deadline for reporting service points for the 2014-2015 school
year is June 15, 2015. Any service points request after June 15, 2015 will not
be honored.</strong>
