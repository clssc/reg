    WAIVER, RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK <br />
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <div>
    In consideration of my participation and/or my minor child’s/children’s
    participation in any program, activity, event or class offered by the
    Chinese Language School of Southern California (CLSSC), including but 
    not limited to programs, activities and events held in-person or virtually
    by video conference or other similar system (collectively, “CLSSC Activities”),
    I hereby waive, release and discharge any and all claims or rights to claims for
    damages for personal injury, death or property damage, including any exposure,
    personal injury, illness, death, quarantine, or isolation from COVID-19, which I
    may have or which may hereafter accrue to me, arising out of or resulting from my
    participation and/or my minor child’s/children’s participation in CLSSC Activities. 
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    I further understand that CLSSC Activities, by their very nature, include inherent
    risks that cannot be eliminated regardless of the care taken to avoid injuries, that
    serious accidents may occur during CLSSC Activities, and that participants may sustain
    mortal or serious personal injuries, and/or property damage, as a consequence thereof.
    Knowing the risks of CLSSC Activities, including any exposure to COVID-19 that may occur
    by participation in CLSSC Activities, nevertheless, I hereby agree on behalf myself and/or
    on behalf of said minor child/children, to assume those risks and to release and hold
    harmless Releasees who, through negligence or carelessness, might otherwise be liable to
    me, or my heirs or assigns for damages.  It is further understood and agreed that this
    waiver, release and assumption of risk is to be binding on my heirs and assigns.
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    I acknowledge that if participating in CLSSC Activities from my home or other location,
    I assume all responsibility for ensuring the location and environment is safe and free
    from obstructions for the purpose of the Activity and assume all risk for any resulting
    injuries or property damage.  I further acknowledge that any use of third-party applications
    (e.g. Zoom, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) is at my own security risk.   
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    I agree to accept and abide by any and all rules and regulations of CLSSC, including those
    pertaining to physical distancing, face coverings, and infection control protocols.  I 
    further agree that I will abide by the all official orders and rules and regulations related 
    to COVID-19 that are in place for CLSSC, Los Angeles County and the State of California, and 
    further will abide by any revised CLSSC, Los Angeles County, and State of California Orders, 
    protocols and regulations that may be issued at any time.
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    I give my permission to CLSSC to photograph or audio/video record me or my minor child/children 
    participating in CLSSC Activities and consent to, without receipt of compensation, the school’s 
    use of audio/video segments or photograph stills of me or my child/children for any lawful 
    purpose, including but not limited to news, advertising and promotional purposes.  I further 
    hereby release and hold harmless Releasees from any claims relating to the use of my likeness 
    and image or those of my child/children.
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    This release extends to all rights, demands, liabilities, obligations, claims or causes of 
    action, in law or equity, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, whether now 
    existing or hereinafter arising, which result from or in any manner relate to enrollment and 
    participation in the Activity.  I further expressly agree to waive all of my rights under 
    California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:  "A general release does not extend to 
    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of 
    executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement 
    with the debtor."
    <p></p>
    <hr />
    I have reviewed the CLSSC Classroom Discipline policy at:

    <p></p>
    I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING, AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY SIGNING THIS RELEASE I AM 
    FOREVER GIVING UP LEGAL RIGHTS TO WHICH I MAY OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED, INCLUDING ALL RIGHTS TO 
    SUE THE CHINESE LANGUAGE SCHOOL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR ITS ELECTED OR APPOINTED BOARDS AND 
    COMMISSIONS, ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES OR TO RECOVER ANY MONEY OR DAMAGES FROM THEM 
    FOR ANY HARM I MAY SUFFER, INCLUDING BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, OCCURRING FROM OR DURING ENROLLMENT 
    AND PARTICIPATION IN CLSSC ACTIVITIES.
