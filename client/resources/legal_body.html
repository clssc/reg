    As a member of CLSSC, I (we) understand and concur that purchasing liability
    insurance coverage other than for enrolled students would result in undue
    financial burden on CLSSC, and it is not necessary. However, I (we) also
    recognize the fact that there is possibility of accident, injury or medical
    emergency occurring to uninsured members, family, relatives or friends. I
    (we) also realize that personal property may be lost or damaged, that certain
    foreseeable and unforeseeable events could contribute to the unpredictability
    of the risks and danger of any activity that I (we) may choose to participate.
    In recognition of the aforementioned potential risks, I (we) assume the risks
    of personal injury, accidents and property loss or damage of the uninsured
    members, family, relatives, friends, and hereby release CLSSC and Los Angeles
    Unified School District from any financial or legal responsibility regardless
    of the cause.<br />
