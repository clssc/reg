    In the next screen you will be asked to fill out our registration form,
    one registration form per family. Before we get started, please read the
    following registration notes:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>All students must be 5 years or older on the first day of the school year.</li>
      <li>The tuition is $700 (or $600 for early registration). Officers, teachers,
      and coaches who meet tuition reduction criteria will be refunded after the
      school year begins.</li>
	  <li>Students whose completed registrations are postmarked by 7/31/2014
	  will receive the textbooks on the first day of school. Students who
	  register after 7/31/2014 are not guaranteed to receive the textbooks
	  on the first day of school.</li>
      <li>Registration deadline and early bird discount deadline are determined by
      payment postmark.</li>
      <li>Each family, except staff and some teachers, shall serve 20 hours
      per year. Each family is required to maintain the $200 service deposit at
      time of registration. For families departing the school, the refund for family service point
	  deposit must be requested within one year from the last day of the academic
	  year in which they depart. After that time, no refund will be granted.</li>
      <li>Students applying for school language credit must take one designated
      extra-curricular class in addition to the regular 3 hours of Chinese
      instruction each week (total of 4 hours per week). Those who miss more than
      12 hours of lessons will not be granted credits. Credit students shall submit
      application form (available upon request in the office), decide extra-curricular
      class and pay for the associated fee on the first class of the school year.</li>
      <li>Extracurricular classes (EC) are optional and open to all students and parents. Fees
      of EC are not included in the tuition and will be collected when you register for EC
	  at the beginning of the school year.</li>
      <li>Registration fee is $100 and non-refundable. Bounced check fee is $30/each.</li>
