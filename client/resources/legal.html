	(we) also realize that personal property may be lost or damaged, that certain

	of the risks and danger of any activity that I (we) may choose to participate.
	In recognition of the aforementioned potential risks, I (we) assume the risks
	of personal injury, accidents and property loss or damage of the uninsured
	members, family, relatives, friends, and hereby release CLSSC and Los Angeles
	Unified School District from any financial or legal responsibility regardless
